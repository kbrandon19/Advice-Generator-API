### What I learned

For this project I just learned the importance or double checking your code and also makeing sure the class and id names and logical.
Also for assigning variables from the DOM to use id to target specific elements.


### Continued development

This challenge for me was just a way for me to continue to understand API better
and how I can use and manipulate the data. For my next project I want to use RapidApi.
